      <h2>18 U.S.C. §2257 Compliance Statement</h2>
      <p>
        All models, actors, actresses and other persons who appear in any visual
        depiction of actual sexually explicit conduct appearing on this website
        were over the age of eighteen (18) years at the time of the creation of

        this website unless specifically stated otherwise. With respect to any
        visual content appearing on this website for which we are the primary

        Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2257(h)(3), all other visual depictions displayed

          §2256(2)(A)–(D), or
        </li>
        <li>They do not portray simulated sexually explicit conduct, or</li>
        <li>They were created prior to July 3, 1995.</li>
